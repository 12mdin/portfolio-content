			<h1>My Villagers</h1>
			The version I played is Animal Crossing: New Horizons. This game was first published on March 20, 2020. My island is located on the North Hemisphere (which is same as real world), so the character in the New Horizons is experiencing the same season and holidays with me. <br />
			<br />
			There is a total of 10 villagers live on my island, which are Blanche, Dom, Fang, Fauna, Ione, Marshal, Molly, Pekoe, Plucky, and Rosie. Villagers can come in sereval different personality types. They include: Jocks, Uchi (Big Sister), Normal, Peppy, Lazy, Snooty, Cranky, and Smug. Certain types of villagers will always show up on your island – as you will always start the game with a Jock and Uchi villager alongside you. <br />
			<br />
			The first two villagers that come to the island with you will build up their own houses from tents, while the next three villagers must have some of their items furnished before they move in. After this, you will be able to sell plots of land for new villagers to set up a house, or invite them to stay while encountered at a Mystery Island or the Campsite. <br />
			<br />
			In this page, I will introduce each one of them and their characteristics.
