      <h1>About Animal Crossing</h1>
      <p>
        Animal Crossing is a social simulation video game series developed and published by Nintendo. 
        In Animal Crossing, the player character is a human who lives in a village inhabited by various anthropomorphic animals and can do various activities like fishing, bug catching, and fossil hunting.
        The version I played is Animal Crossing: New Horizons. This game was first published in March 2020. In New Horizons, the player controls a character who moves to a deserted island after purchasing a getaway package from Tom Nook, accomplishes assigned tasks, and develops the island as they choose.

        Nintendo had their latest update on Nov 3, 2021, along with the Happy Home Paradise DLC. In this DLC, clients with different dream vacation requests will visit a new resort area located in an archipelago, made up of several different island. The player can talk to a client and find out the details of their requests and make their dreams happen.

       In this website, I will show you something about my island – the villagers who live on the island, the items I have, and a gallery page showing some important moments.
