			<h1>About Animal Crossing</h1>
			<p>
				Animal Crossing is a social simulation video game series developed and published by Nintendo. 
				In Animal Crossing, the player character is a human who lives in a village inhabited by various anthropomorphic animals and can do various activities like fishing, bug catching, and fossil hunting.
				The version I played is Animal Crossing: New Horizons. This game was first published in March 2020. In New Horizons, the player controls a character who moves to a deserted island after purchasing a getaway package from Tom Nook, accomplishes assigned tasks, and develops the island as they choose. <br />
				<br />
				Nintendo had their latest update on Nov 3, 2021, along with the Happy Home Paradise DLC. In this DLC, clients with different dream vacation requests will visit a new resort area located in an archipelago, made up of several different island. The player can talk to a client and find out the details of their requests and make their dreams happen. <br>
				<br />
				In this website, I will show you something about my island – the villagers who live on the island, the items I have, and a gallery page showing some important moments.
